# Introduction

This project is a visualization tool for 2D Rayleigh-Bénard Convection. The software receives input from user interface then displays a corresponding data set generated using numerical simulation.

## Goals and Objectives
The goal of this project is to create a user interface to interactively set simulation parameters and view the results of the simulation. The example we use for the project is Rayleigh-Benard convection, although this idea could easily be extended to other numerical simulations of other phenomena.

Our objectives are as follows:
- accept simulation and visualization parameters from the user via a graphical user interface, and display the results
- numerically simulate Rayleigh--Bénard convection based on input parameters
- visualize the data from the simulation, and pass the results to the gui for display

# Software Architectural Design
Our project is divided as three parts: numerical simulation of 2D Rayleigh-Bénard Convection, data visualization of simulation and GUI design. The simulation will produce data for fluid velocity and temperature for each mesh node for data visualization.

The input of data visualization is the result of Rayleigh-Bénard Convection simulation and the resulting graphics should be exported to GUI section. It gives users a direct view of their calculation and help them to better understand Rayleigh--B\'enard Convection or the errors occurred in their calculation. The configurations should include output map layer, dimensions of output, color schemes and result export format.

The graphical user interface (GUI) is like the conductor of the project. The GUI will receive simulation and visualization parameters from the user and show the the visualization of the corresponding simulation case.

A block diagram representation of our program is below:

# Interface Descriptions
## Graphical Interface
Our GUI has two windows. The main window contains three buttons for users to control the project and a parameter display table, which cannot be edited by users. The first time user start our project, all the parameters are of default values.

![main window](https://github.com/ENGN2912B-2018/HPC-A/blob/master/images/GUI-MainWindow.png)

After pressing "parameter setting" button, a new parameter window will jump out. The parameter window contains two part: the simulation parameter setting part and the visualization parameter setting part.
For the simulation setting part, user can choose the value of Pr and Ra. When they click "apply simulation changes", GUI will set the parameters with the new value. It will also generate a file path to read the pre-stored simulation data, which is accociated with the chosen Pr value and Ra value.

For the visualization part, users can choose different color scheme and time steps. They can choose to visualize convection temperature T or fluid velocity mag(U). Then click "apply visualization changes" to assign new values to the visualization parameters.

   ![visualization](https://github.com/ENGN2912B-2018/HPC-A/blob/master/images/visParameter.png)

When users have made changes to parameters of interest, they can press "apply changes" to display the latest parameter value in the main window. Then press "visualization" button to start visualization. If some parameters remain unchanged, a message box will jump out to tell users whether they want to continue visualization with default values.

![msgbox](https://github.com/ENGN2912B-2018/HPC-A/blob/master/images/msg%20box.png)

Our project cannot be real time, so after users press "visualization", they have to wait for a while because the project has to read vtk data first. When the time step is 2, it takes the longest time to read data and visualize them. Therefore, if users want to see the whole progress in much shorter time, they need to choose 20 to be the time step.

## Data Visualization
The data visualization module reads the data from `.vtk` files generated by OpenFOAM in VTK's `vtkUnstructuredGrid` format, maps it into a 2D plane object with different colors, and renders the results in an OpenGL window. Windows `AVI` video can also be generated and saved during the visualization process.  

The module is mainly implemented as `VTKReaderLibrary` in the `VTKReader.h` and `VTKReader.cpp` files under both `\visualization\src` and `gui\RBCGUI` folders, providing both support for graphical and command-line interfaces. The `mainVisualizer.cxx` file itself is the source code of self-contained command-line based app that directly uses the library and generated the desired results.

## Communications Protocols
### Simulation and Visualization
The simulation and visualization components are connected using OpenFOAM's `writeVTK` function method. `writeVTK` automatically generates `vtkUnstructuredGrid` files that can be read by VTK's reader methods during the simulation process.

### Qt, Simulation and Visualization
Since for different values of simulation parameter Pr and Ra, the data generated by OpenFOAM are stored in different folders. The name of every folder is consist of the name and value of these two parameter. Therefore, the control of simulation is just as easy as open an assigned folder.

In order to call the visualization in Qt, we wrap the main function of the VTK program in the callback function of "visualization" button. Also, other source code and header file of VTK program should be added into Qt program. 

## Threading and Concurrency
The OpenMP API is applied by our data visualization library to parallelize and accelerate the data processing and visualization pipeline. With parallelizaton, the files are processed by multiple threads in the same time, and the total run time is decreased to 13% (from 60 seconds to 8 seconds when 8 threads are used) of that of the original system under certain multithreading schedule and operating system conditions.

## Exception Handling
Exception handling techniques are implemented in our system. Three types of exceptions are defined in the program:
1. The program fails to locate the folder of the simulation results;

2. The simulation results do not exist or are corrupted;

3. All other unexpected exceptions, such as the computational resources are exhausted by the program.  

In all of those situations, the program will terminate, and pop up different messages. For the file I/O issues, we will prompt the user to check the file path and parameter settings; and for the unexpected exceptions, we will prompt the user to contact us in the [Github Issues Page](https://github.com/ENGN2912B-2018/HPC-A/issues).

In addition, in the helper program we used behind the scenes to automatically generate data sets, if the user provides an invalid input, they are prompted to try again until an acceptable value is received.

## Description of functional testing to date
### Simulation
To provide a versatile method for running several OpenFOAM simulations in sequence, we wrote a wrapper for the OpenFOAM convection simulation which can read and modify an OpenFOAM test case. Upon verifying that the simulation parameters could be successfully changed from within a C++ file, we then implemented a program to automate the generation of data sets for cases Rayleigh-Bénard Convection with varying Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers for use by the visualization and graphical interface parts of the project. The person creating these data sets has the ability to determine the number of Ra and Pr values to draw combinations from, and to set them via command line. This way, a collection of data sets can be generated incrementally if they do not have access to the CCV for an extended time, and new data sets can be added easily if needed.
### Visualization
#### Identification of functions, expected inputs and outputs
For conducting functional tests for visualization components, we implemented a driver program named `mainVisualizer`.
The inputs of `mainVisualizer` are commands from user input which specify visualization parameters, and `.vtk` files that generated from the simulation components. The `.vtk` files can also be downloaded from [this Google Drive page](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uOd3skYjSeGgKKKBibIzqVxK3MpL1rfd).
The expected output of `mainVisualizer` should be a OpenGL render window showing the visualization results in an animation. In Windows 10, an optional Windows AVI video can also be saved in the same directory as the `.vtk` files.
#### Execution, actual outputs and evaluation
**Linux:**   
Under the terminal, we ran the `./mainVisualizer` file and enter the parameters as the instructions.

![Linux Command-line tool](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/315072-8ab196915da0c1cc.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)
Then the results were generated in an Open GL render window.

**Windows:**   
We directly double clicked the `mainVisualizer` executable and enter the parameters as the instructions.
![Windows Command-line tool](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/315072-a6dd5569c8ec2a20.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)
Then the results were generated in an OpenGL render window.  
![Execution results](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/315072-f191266d7938752d.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)
A video was also generated in the same path as the `.vtk` files, and the results are the same as shown in the OpenGL render window.  
![Saved video file](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/315072-31016b8b59ccc209.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

We can say that the visualization module passed the functional tests according to the results.

# Conclusions
As of today, our GUI hasn't implemented the selecting of the data reading path, so users have to change the vtk data path in code before the program is built. Also, after pressing the visualization button, the GUI window does not respond. That may be the reason of QVTKOpenGLWidget can only display the last figure of the visualization. Therefore, we have to give up using QVTKOpenGLWidget to display visualization in Qt main window. Muilt-threads in GUI may solve such problem but it is a little bit complicated, which will take more time.

# Future Work
### Multi-Platform Support
Our main application can only work on Windows 10 operating system. Linux-based operating systems(including the Brown CCV environment) are not supported due to an incompatible OpenGL version. For the users who want to simulate the Rayleigh-Bénard Convection on Linux systems, we offer a [command-line based solution](https://github.com/ENGN2912B-2018/HPC-A/blob/master/VisualizationGuide.md) that can work on both Windows and Linux. One possible future work for our project is to provide support for multi-platform development.

### Modification of More Simulation Parameters
Once we are able to integrate the simulation with the visualization and the GUI on the same system, then the next step would be to enable the user to change more simulation parameters from the GUI. For example, the simulation time step, the domain width and height, and the mesh resolution are parameters which were kept constant in this version due to limited time and resources. Additionally, future versions of this project could allow the user to change physical properties of the fluid to change the non-dimensional parameters. This would illustrate the idea that the same fluid behavior can be observed even in different physical conditions.
